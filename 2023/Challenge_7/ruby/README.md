# Obfuscate

## Setup

The generator program creates the `main.rb` file that obfuscated echoing
`Hello World!` to the terminal

```ruby
ruby generator.rb
```

## Run 

The main.rb program will print `Hello World!` using an obfuscated call. 
Note some editors will have issue opening this file due to embeded data body.

```ruby
ruby main.rb
```
